# jQuery, JSON & AJAX Chat Application

This application was made and deployed to practically apply my recently acquired jQuery, JSON and AJAX skills. Using event-driven and asynchronous programming in JavaScript, back-end server-side programming in PHP, I heavily manipulated the DOM and communicated the changes in real-time with the server, using AJAX. Moreover, CSS was used intensively from scratch to create appealing and easy-on-eyes GUI. It took me a total of 5 days to create and deploy this project

Please do remember that it is just a concept application which mimics the chatting experience but does not allow people to chat with each other in any way. All chat messages are cached in the PHP SESSION super-global associative array. So, reloading the window or even force-flushing the in-browser cache will not remove your messages
